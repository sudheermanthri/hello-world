# hello-world,

I am Sudheer Manthri. A total newbie to programming and coding. I have commenced learning Python3 and invested some time on online video training on learning about pseudocodes and flowcharts. As a novice I have a million questions that keeps getting appended on a daily basis! Looking forward to help from every direction. - SM
